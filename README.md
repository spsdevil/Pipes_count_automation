# Pipes_count_automation
this is complete automation of pipes counting from the image of pipes loaded on truck or else where, it uses circle detection using opencv. I have created simple flask app for using it anywhere after hosting, you con modify frontend and make it look great, or if you only need backend work to be done, then this is complete.
